# Vimstalled API

This is the api for a stupid [chrome extension](https://github.com/22a/vimstalled) I'm writing.

The interesting thing about this piece of code is that it was written by a person who doesn't know Elixir and has been googling how solve problems as they arise.

I really wouldn't recommend reading it, I'll come back and rewrite this after I've learned how to use the language.

## Installation
